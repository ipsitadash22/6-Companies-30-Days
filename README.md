# 6-Companies-30-Days


Taking up the #6Companies30Days challenge inspired by Arsh Goyal, all while managing mid-semester exams, projects, and hackathons! ðŸŽ¯

Itâ€™s a packed schedule, but Iâ€™m determined to stay consistent, push boundaries, and keep learning every step of the way. ðŸš€

Iâ€™ll be documenting my journey and sharing solutions on GitHub. Feel free to explore them here: GitHub Repository
